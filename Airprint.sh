# Bash script to mirror shared local OSX printers to Airprint using lpstat and ipprint
# Tested in MacOSX 10.10 Yosemite

# Does not use dns-sd as it frequently fails inside bash scripting
# Printer is registered as Airprint_Queuename @ OSXComputerName with underscores
# instead of a pretty printer service name with spaces and hyphens

# Limitation: The URF string may vary by printer capabilities. See https://wiki.debian.org/AirPrint
